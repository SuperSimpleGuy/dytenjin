||Dynamic Text--Based Java Game Engine||
||====================================||
This is an engine for making dynamic text-based java games.

Last Version Release: Never
Current version: VersionNotFoundException

Goal:

Have it such that basic game developers can extend and
create new java classes to add specific behaviors not
included in the framework. Dialog options and such can
be written to basic text files parsed dynamically at
runtime within the framework to generate descriptions,
dialog, flavor text, etc. This allows for more focus
on richer story lines, more people to add enhanced
features than what I can think of, and a retro feel
better than "You find yourself alone in a dark
forest".
