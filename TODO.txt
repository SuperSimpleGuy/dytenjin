TODO:
==========
Actually think through about how I want to do this.

Finish javadocing existing code.
Work heavily on aspects (possessions, environment, terrain, history, stats),
	like what is IAspect doing besides being pretty?
Refactor GeoRegion to have generic aspect manager instead of lots of
	hardcoded aspects.
Refactor interfaces dealing with in-game stats (hunger, thirst, health)
	and make them more aspect-oriented
Not create more confusing stats about the game (I'm looking at you TimeDepStat
	and GeographicalRegionStatsManager)
